# Google Maps API Setup Guide

## üîë Setting Up Your Google Maps API Key

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable billing for your project (required for Maps API)

### Step 2: Enable the Maps JavaScript API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
2. Search for "Maps JavaScript API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
3. Copy your new API key

### Step 4: Restrict Your API Key (Recommended)

1. Click on your newly created API key
2. Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
3. Add your domain(s):
   - `localhost:3000/*` (for development)
   - `yourdomain.com/*` (for production)
4. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
5. Select "Maps JavaScript API" from the dropdown
6. Click "Save"

### Step 5: Add API Key to Your Project

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

### Step 6: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
