  intro: `Herman's Bakery was established in September 1944 on the heels of World War II, when the people of Saipan were detained at Camp Susupe and Navy administrators announced that a bread baker was needed for the residents of the camp. Herman had apprenticed at a Japanese bakery in Garapan and now having a young family to support, he stepped forward and gladly filled this position. He baked daily bread using U.S. Navy-provided equipment and supplies. After the release of the civilian population from Camp Susupe, Herman decided that the nickname given to him "Pan" (which means bread in Chamorro) was a good fit for his life. He built a bakery facility with surplus military materials in Chalan Kanoa where the bakery operated until 1979, when the family business was moved to its present location.`,
  about: `Herman's wife, Maria, better known as "Tan Marikita" was well known throughout Saipan for her generous spirit and hospitality. She opened her heart and home to many. We hope the menu choices offered by Tan Marikita's Cafe will be satisfying and enjoyable just as they were at her table, where everyone was welcomed and treated like family. While you're here don't forget to take home some of our famous Herman's Modern Bakery's Pan Tuba, Sweet Bread, Pan Toasta, and other favorite pastries. Si Yu'us Ma'ase, Warmest Hafa Adai. Where breakfast is served to perfection all day long!`,
